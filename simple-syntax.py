# defining variable, python does not need the variable type
x = 5

# if statetements dont need parentheses and statements end in a colon ":" 
if x == 5:
    # python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code
    # must use comma or str() to print number variables with string
    print("x is ",x)

# example how not to indent and a multiline comment

print("This is okay")
    print("This is not okay")

# single and double quotes are the same in python
print("This is double quotes")
print('This is single quotes')

# variables are CaSe sensitive
